# METAHUMANS HUNTER APPLICATION
This is a superhero hunter application which I have created using superhero api and basic web development languages.
This application consists of total three pages:

1. It is a home page and cosists links of other two pages. On this page you can search your superhero as well as store it in favorite list.
While searching for superhero you need to type minimum 3 words on basis of that you will find similar characters in option from there you can select
your choice of hero.
